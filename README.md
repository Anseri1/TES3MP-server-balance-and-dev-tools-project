# TES3MP-server-balence-and-dev-tools-project
this project aims to make TES3MP server development much more newcomer friendly by providing tools that automate much of the game testing and help with some of the game design challenges.

## binomial distribution tool
using this you'll be able to simulate a bunch of item farming attempts at a given drop rate and have it spit out a bunch of statistics

you could also use it to test the proc rate at a given proc chance for hidden effects

you could even use it for something like simulating spell casting/hit chance/lockpicking/persuasion/potion making/barter attempt success rate at a given number of attempts provided you know the success chance for one attempt

you can find the formulas for those things on the OpenMW research page
